# Model-Home-Security-System
I created a model home security system using the TI MSP 430 microcontroller and various electronic components. The electronic components that I used for this project include: a 2x16 LCD display, a 4x4 keypad, a buzzer, two PIR motion sensors and three 5mm LEDs (red, green and blue colors).
